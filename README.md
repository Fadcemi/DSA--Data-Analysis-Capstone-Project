# DSA-SQL-CASE-STUDY SOLUTIONS

This is my Portfolio Building for the DSA-SQL Questions for Data Analysis

## Project Topic: Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) Inventory

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the KMS Inventory
using SQL Skills in solving the two case scenarios. In computing the solution, the returned orders were taken into consideration. 

### Data Source
The Primary source of data used is the Excel file containing order data from 2009- 2012

### Tools Used
- MS Excel for data cleaning
- SQL Server for querying and Analysis
### Data Preparation
A Microsoft Excel Worksheet (xlsv) dataset which contains the Orders from 2009 to 2012 was provided for analysis consisting of 8400 rows and 18 columns. Other information provided include Customer Name, Returned Item and Users. In preparing the data the first step taken was to Prepare the Excel workbook, ensuring the Excel file was shapened as seen in the figures displayed above, what this means is I converted the data set into a Table so as to make it easier to work with. An overview of the dataset is shown below:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data such as:
- Which product category had the highest sales?
- What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions in terms of sales?
- What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
- Advise the management of KMS on what to to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
- KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
- Who are the most valuable customers and what products or services do they typically purchase?
- Which small business customer had the highest sales?
- Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012? 
- Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
- Which customer returned items and what segment do they belong.
- If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowestshipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

 ### Data Analysis
  This is where some basic lines of codes or queries were used during the analysis to obtain the solution to the questions. Below are the codes for each of the questions

### Conclusion
From the above solutions to the pertinent questions asked, the Management of Kultra Mega Stores will be guided on the best actions to take in improving their sales while noting the best and cheapest shipping method. Also, to increase revenue for the bottom 10 customers, the Management should increase the Advertisement rate of the Products these categories of cutomers purchase.
